# Generating Summary of given Text : Project OverviewðŸŽ¯
## Problem Statement
Summaries reduce reading time. When researching documents, summaries make the selection process easier. Automatic summarization improves the effectiveness of indexing. Automatic summarization algorithms are less biased than human summarizers. Reading a summary help us to identify the interest area, gives a brief context of the story.
Hence this summary generator can help in automation of the process and make it more effective and unbiased.

## Novelty
I have used textrank as an approach to rank the sentences based on calculated cosine similarity. TextRank does not rely on any previous training data and can work with any arbitrary piece of text and it is a general purpose graph-based ranking algorithm for NLP.
